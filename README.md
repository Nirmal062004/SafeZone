# 🛡️ SafeZone App

This is **SafeZone**, a personal safety app I built using React Native (Expo) and Firebase — fully powered by **free tools** and designed for real-time emergency support.

### 🚨 What It Does

- One-tap **SOS alert** with real-time location
- **Live location sharing** to trusted contacts
- **Voice-activated trigger** (say a keyword to send SOS)
- **Fake call feature** to help escape unsafe situations
- **Push notifications** for instant alerts
- Nearby **safe places** search (via OpenStreetMap & Nominatim API)
